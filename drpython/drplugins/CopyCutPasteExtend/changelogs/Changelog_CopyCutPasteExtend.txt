Version: 1.0.9 (21.01.2005), Franz Steinhaeusler: 
  - update for wxPython 2.8 and DrPython 1.65.
  
Version: 1.0.8 (21.01.2005), Franz Steinhaeusler: 
  - updated for DrPython 3.9.1
      (replaced homedirectory with userpreferencesdirectory)

Version: 1.0.7 (16.12.2004), Franz Steinhaeusler: 
- new opton "AdjustText"
    example: you have a file with tabs and unix line endings.
    then you copy for instance from demo, which 
    is on windows with crlf and spaces.
    after paste, the file is mixed with spaces and tabs and line endings lf and crlf.
    
    So I made an option in copycutpasteexend.
    It tries to accommodate to the current tab or spaces
    and to change the text to the current line endings.
    I called this preference "AdjustText".

Version: 1.0.6 (25.11.2004), Franz Steinhaeusler:

  - new: MultiClipBoard (works only with copy/cut special/append and copywordundercursor and pastealternative)
  - new: able to save Multiple Clip Entries
  - new: CopyCurrentWord
  - new: show and select one entry from the Multiple Clipboard (Listbox)
  - added to preferences: Multiple Clipboard

Version: 1.0.5 (04.11.2004), Franz Steinhaeusler: 
  - improved paste from rectangular selection 
      * show pasted text as selection again
         (anchor in the beginning, a little circumstantial, but I think, it works)
      * insert spaces, if line is shorter than position of pasted text
  - less steps in undo

	- three options on paste:
